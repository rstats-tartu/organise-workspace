## Look at your data with computer eye

- There is difference in data that is formatted for humans to view by eye with data that is formatted for a computer ([Bad data handbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024422.do))

- Data organised keeping only human eye in mind with some complex arrangements requires generally much more work/code to extract

- If dataset is not intended only to be used privately (replicability and reproducibility!), then it is important that external data analysts be able to work with such complex data files   

- If the initial arrangement of the data files is planned with the computer in mind, the later analysis process is simplified
