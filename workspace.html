## People love spreadsheets

- Spreadsheets play a significant role in researchers' workflows:
    - you can have everything in one bucket (container) your precious data, summary stats, figures, and modeling results
    
    - data sharing is therefore very easy -- just send your spreadsheet file to your collaborator and she/he has immediately data, analysis and work environment
    
- Spreadsheets offer organised way to manually enter data, you have clearly organised grid of cells in front of you, just start typing

- Spreadsheets allow select and filter your data, you can highlight cells of interest and etc.


---

## Dangers of spreadsheets

- European Spreadsheet Risks Interest Group keeps a public archive of common problems caused by spreadsheets and shows also associated financial risks (http://www.eusprig.org/horror-stories.htm)

-  For example, study doing 13 audits of real-world spreadsheets showed that an average of 88% contained errors ([Panko (2008)](http://panko.shidler.hawaii.edu/SSR/Mypapers/whatknow.htm))

- MS Excel converts some gene names to dates (for exmple 'Oct4') and stores dates differently between operating systems, which can cause problems in downstream analyses ([Zeeberg, 2004](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-5-80) and other [scary Excel stories](https://github.com/jennybc/scary-excel-stories))


---

## Spreadsheets for data entry and storage

- Spreadsheets are best suited to data entry and storage    

- Analysis and visualisation should happen separately     

- **Analyzing and visualizing data in a separate program**, or at least in a separate copy of the data file, 
    - **reduces the risk of contaminating or destroying the raw data** in the spreadsheet

---

## Look at your data with computer eye

- There is difference in data that is formatted for humans to view by eye with data that is formatted for a computer ([Bad data handbook](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024422.do))

- Data organised keeping only human eye in mind with some complex arrangements requires generally much more work/code to extract

- If dataset is not intended only to be used privately (replicability and reproducibility!), then it is important that external data analysts be able to work with such complex data files   

- If the initial arrangement of the data files is planned with the computer in mind, the later analysis process is simplified 

---

## Follow rules

- Organizing spreadsheet data in a way that both humans and computer programs can read will help to create 
    1. spreadsheets that are less error-prone, 
    1. easier for computers to process, and 
    1. easier to share with collaborators and the public
    
- Spreadsheets that adhere to recommendations will form the basis of a robust and reproducible analytic workflow

- For an existing dataset please don't do hand-editing to revise the arrangement 

- Apply these principles when designing the layout for future datasets

---

## Be consistent

Consistency saves time later when you and your collaborators harmonise data

- Use **consistent codes** for categorical variables (e.g. for sex use either male/female or M/F)
- Use a consistent fixed code for any **missing values** (use NA for explicit missing values, not 999/-999)
- Use consistent **variable names** (no whitespace!)
- Use consistent **subject identifiers** (no concurrent use of mouse3321 and 3321)
- Use a consistent **data layout** in multiple files (with a consistent structure, it will be easy to automate data analysis process)
- Use consistent **file names** (no whitespace!)
- Use a consistent format for all **dates** (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Be **careful about extra spaces** within cells

---

## Choose good names

- As a general rule, don't use spaces, either in variable names or file names
- Use underscores or hyphens if necessary, but don't mix them
- Use short, but meaningful names. Not too short!

good name | good alternative | avoid
----------|------------------|-------
Max_temp_C | MaxTemp | Maximum Temp (°C)
Precipitation_mm | Precipitation | precmm
Mean_year_growth | MeanYearGrowth | Mean growth/year
sex | sex | M/F
weight | weight | w.
cell_type | CellType | Cell type
Observation_01 | first_observation | 1st Obs.

Never include "final" in a file name. You will invariably end up with "final ver2"!

---

## Write dates as YYYY-MM-DD

- Use consistenly global ISO 8601 standard: YYYY-MM-DD, such as 2018-06-05.

### Example spreadsheet with inconsistent date formats

???

- Prefer to use a plain text format for columns in an Excel worksheet that are going to contain dates, so that it doesn't do anything to them. To do this:

    - Select the column
    - In the menu bar, select Format → Cells 
    - ' Choose 'Text' on the left

- If you do this on columns that already contain dates, Excel will convert them to a text value of their underlying numeric representation      
- Another way to force Excel to treat dates as text is to begin the date with an apostrophe, like this: '2014-06-14 (see http://bit.ly/twitter_apos). Excel will treat the cells as text, but the apostrophe will not appear when you view the spreadsheet or export it to other formats     
- Alternatively, you could create three separate columns with year, month, and day. Those will be ordinary numbers, and so Excel won’t mess them up     
- Finally, you could represent dates as an 8-digit integer of the form YYYYMMDD, for example 20140614 for 2014-06-14          

---

## No empty cells

- Fill in all cells, use some common code for missing data!

- Label missing data explicitly with "NA" or even with hyphen "-"

- Pathological cases of tables with missing values:

&lt;img src="img/spreadsheets-fig2.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

- The spreadsheet in right has a complex layout with information for different treatments. 
- It is ~clear that columns B-E all concern the '1 min' treatment, and columns F-I all concern '5 min', and that columns B, C, F, and G all concern 'normal', while columns D, E, H, and I concern 'mutant'. 
- While it may be easy to see by eye, it can be hard to deal with this in later analyses
- You could fill in some of those cells, to make it more clear. 
- Alternatively, make a 'tidy' version of the data, with each row being one replicate/observation and with the response values all in one column

---

### Tidy version of data

Tidy data has variables in columns and observations in rows

---

## Keep your table rectangular

- The best layout for your data within a spreadsheet is as a single big rectangle with rows corresponding to subjects and columns corresponding to variables    

- The first row should contain variable names     

- **Don't use more than one row for the variable names**     

???

- Some datasets won't fit nicely into a single rectangle, but they will usually fit into a set of rectangles

- in which case you can make a set of Excel files, each with a rectangle of data

- It is best to keep each rectangle in its own file 

- tables scattered around a worksheet are difficult to work with, and they make it hard to export the data to CSV files

- consider having a single Excel file with multiple worksheets

## Double headers

- Avoid double headers!

.pull-left[
- Problematic table with double headers

]

.pull-right[

]

## No calculations in the raw data files

- **Your primary data file should contain just the data and nothing else**: no calculations, no graphs

- Your primary data file should be a pristine store of data. Write-protect it, back it up, and don't touch it

- If you want to do some analyses in Excel, make a copy of the file and do your calculations and graphs in the copy


???

- If you are doing calculations in your data file, that likely means you are regularly opening it and typing into it. 

- Doing so incurs some risk that you will accidentally type junk into your data.

- (Has this happened to you? You open an Excel file and start typing and nothing happens, and then you select a cell and you can start typing. 

- Where did all of that initial text go? 

- Well, sometimes it got entered into some random cell, to be discovered later during data analysis.)

---

## Don't use font color or highlighting as data

- You might be tempted to highlight particular cells with suspicious data, or rows that should be ignored. Or the font or font color might have some meaning    

- The highlighting is visually appealing, but this information is hard to extract from spreadsheet file

- Instead, add another column with an indicator variable (for example, column "trusted", with values TRUE or FALSE)    

&lt;img src="img/spreadsheets-fig10.png" width="99%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

---

## Save the data in plain text files

- Keep a copy of your data files in a plain text format, with comma or tab delimiters. Preferably comma-delimited (CSV) files

- you can open the CSV file in Excel or another spreadsheet program and view it in the standard way

- Text-based non-proprietary file format does not and never will require any sort of special software

---

## Summary

- Spreadsheet programs (such as Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and LibreOffice Calc) can also be used for calculations, analysis, and visualizations

- It is recommended for users interested in doing calculations or making data visualizations within spreadsheets
    - keep primary data files pristine and data-only
    - do calculations and visualizations in separate files
